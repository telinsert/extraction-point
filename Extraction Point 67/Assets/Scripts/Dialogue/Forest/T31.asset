  - speakerName: Moe
    sentence: Currently, I recommend distributing upgrades evenly among yourselves
      so that no one is left behind in terms of upgrades later on. Avoid the third
      column until later, when stronger upgrades become available.
    buttonText: 
  - speakerName: Moe
    sentence: Most upgrades early on unlock new upgrades that will appear in the
      loot pool. These include synergy upgrades that appear in the third column when
      both players possess a specific upgrade.
    buttonText: 
  - speakerName: Moe
    sentence: These synergy upgrades that appear in the team upgrade column are often
      much more substantial than regular upgrades, so it's best to acquire even the
      weaker regular upgrades at first, as they could unlock strong upgrades later.
    buttonText: Got it.
